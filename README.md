# 📱 Calculator System 

## 📌 Overview
This project is entirely based on my idea and specifications. It is a **calculator system** that allows users to input mathematical equations through a Graphical User Interface **(GUI)**. The system checks the validity of the equations, converts valid ones to prefix notation, evaluates them, and displays the results. The application is developed using **Java** with **JavaFX**, featuring a GUI with both mouse and keyboard controls. It has been compiled into an executable **(.exe)** file.

## 💡 Features
- **User input support** via a GUI.
- **Checks validity** of each equation (balanced parentheses, correct operators, etc.).
- **Converts valid infix equations to prefix notation**.
- **Evaluates the prefix expressions** and displays the results.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** built with **JavaFX**.
- **Mouse and keyboard support** for user interaction.
- **Generated EXE application** for ease of use.

## 📊 How It Works
1. **User enters an equation** in the GUI input field.
2. The application **processes the equation**.
3. **Validation check:** 
   - If an equation is **invalid**, a message is displayed.
   - If valid, it is converted to **prefix notation**.
4. **Prefix expressions are evaluated** to obtain results.
5. The results are **displayed in the GUI**.

## 🖥️ Technologies Used
- **Java** (for core logic)
- **JavaFX** (for GUI)
- **Prefix Notation Conversion** (Algorithm Implementation)
- **Stacks and Linked Lists** (for equation processing and evaluation)
